## README

This iOS app displays information on all the apps installed on the device.It makes use of
private classes and, as such, will be rejected if submitted to Apple's App Store. I find
looking at this info interesting/educational; I hope you do as well.

## Future Development

<del>There will most likely be little or no future development of this project, although</del>
From time to time, when I need a simple project to use as a test-bed for new ideas, I may add functionality
to this project. Also if/when an idea occurs for an interesting extension, I might add it.
For example, it just occured (Jan '15) to me that `LSWorkspace` must (*might*) have a way to launch apps. And voil√†,
**AppLister** now has that functionality.

In addition, I will attempt to address bug reports, pull requests, etc. promptly. I am particularly interested
in hearing suggestions on how I can improve my Swift coding.

The little bit of Objective-C that exists in this project is there because I couldn't
figure out a Swift equivalent---particularly a work-around for `performSelector`. Note
the existance of the `AppInfo` class is almost entirely due to repeated segfaults when
trying to use `LSApplicationProxy` more directly.
